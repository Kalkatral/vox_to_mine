1. for each voxel:
    //// check the maximum box size going forward ////
    1.1. increment x until you hit void
    1.2. store the max x that was hit
    1.3. increment y
    1.4. jump to 1.1, also if the max x that was hit was smaller than the previous replace the previous; store the max y that was hit
    1.5. store the max y that was hit
    1.6. increment z
    1.7. jump to 1.3, also if the max y that was hit was smaller than the previous replace the previous; store the max z that was hit
    1.8. store the max z that was hit
    ////////////////////////////////////////////////// -> max x, max y, max z

    1.8. store the start of the box (the coords of the current voxel) and the end of the box (the start + max x, max y, max z) in the Boxes object

2. get the best volume box and store it into the JsonSerializer object
3. set the voxels contained in the best volume box to void (0)
4. clear the Boxes object
5. if all voxels are not void (0) jump to 1 otherwise end
